Overview

 Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation involved working as a Data Analyst for a hypothetical social media client. I cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover content trends, which helped inform strategic business decisions. My work included preparing a PowerPoint deck and a video presentation to communicate key insights to both the client and internal stakeholders.

 Participating in this job simulation gave me hands-on experience with data analytics and visualization in a realistic context. I enjoyed cleaning, modeling, and analyzing data, as well as presenting insights in a meaningful way. This experience made me even more excited to contribute to a dynamic team at Accenture, where I can apply these skills to real-world projects.These following tasks i complete in this project.

 Task 1 This was an MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) task, and it was quite easy to solve.

 Task 2 There were CSV files that needed to be cleaned using either Excel or SQL, depending on which tool was easier to use. I choose Excel for cleaning.

Task 3 The third task was to create a PowerPoint presentation based on the analysis.

Task 4 In this task, we had to present the PowerPoint presentation we created in Task 3 by making our video explaining the content of the presentation.
